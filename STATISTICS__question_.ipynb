It implies that as the amount of sleep increases or decreases, there is a corresponding change in the level of productive work. However, correlation does not imply causation.

It is an inherent part of the sampling process and results from the fact that a sample is not a perfect representation of the entire population.

Marketers create two or more versions (A, B, etc.) of a webpage, email, ad, or other content. Then, they randomly assign users to each version and collect data on user behavior. Hypothesis testing is used to analyze this data and determine whether there are statistically significant differences in user behavior between the different versions.

Inliers are important in various data analysis techniques, including clustering, where they help define the clusters or groups of data points."
